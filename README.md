## 🇮🇳 सरल हिन्दी में

LogSentinel Linux ke system logs ko read karta hai aur check karta hai:

- kaun baar-baar galat password se login try kar raha hai
- kaun user bahut zyada sudo use kar raha hai
- kya koi user dono jagah suspicious behaviour dikha raha hai

Aur phir batata hai:

👉 system me koi real security incident ho sakta hai ya nahi.
